## 📌 Notes

- While **OpenXR** is generally preferred for long-term stability and cross-platform support, this demo uses **SteamVR** as a core requirement.
- SteamVR does **not support Android builds**, so no `.apk` file is included. To build for Android, consider switching to **OpenXR** or another XR plugin that supports it.
- 🥚 *Easter Egg?* Maybe… explore the scene carefully 😉
